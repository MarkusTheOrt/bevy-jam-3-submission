# Bevy Game Jam 3 Game submission

The Theme of this game jam is ***Side Effects***

## Game Idea

This game is supposed to be a 2D Platformer where you have to solve different
kinds of puzzles to reach the next level. However every few seconds or so there
are different side effects (e.g. Faster Speed, Inverted Gravity, Low Gravity / 
higher jumps, Inverted or blocked controls and more....) The setting might be
that this game is set in a testing facility (think black mesa from Half Life 1)
and therefore things happen, whilst going through that entire thing you might
also have to press a few buttons which opens gates to new sections of the game

I don't know how much of this I will be able to accomplish in time since this
is my first time participating in a Bevy game jam (Also first time working) in
bevy so I guess I wish myself luck!


Maybe this all will fail horribly :P 
Time will tell!
